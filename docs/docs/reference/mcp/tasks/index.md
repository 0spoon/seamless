# Tasks

> The six task tools - the dependency-aware ready queue and lease-based claiming that lets parallel agents divide work safely.

Tasks are how agents hand work to each other. A task is **ready** when it has no
unfinished blocker; `tasks_ready` returns exactly those, so an agent asking "what
can I do now?" never has to reason about the dependency graph itself.

## How claiming works

Claiming is the concurrency control. Two agents that both see the same ready task
will both try to take it, and exactly one wins:

1. `tasks_claim` atomically moves a ready task to `in_progress` and stamps a
   lease (default 900 seconds). The loser gets an error naming the holder.
2. Re-claiming a task you already hold **refreshes** the lease - that is the
   heartbeat for long work.
3. An **expired** lease is reclaimable *by id* - but the task stays
   `in_progress`, so `tasks_ready` does not show it. Only releasing it (by hand,
   or by the gardener's session reaper expiring the dead holder's session) sets
   the status back to `open` and returns it to the queue. See [the two
   clocks](https://thereisnospoon.org/docs/concepts/tasks-and-plans/).
4. `tasks_release`, closing the task (`tasks_update` to `done`/`dropped`), or
   `session_end` frees the claim.

A lease is not a lock on the files - it is a coordination signal between
cooperating agents. Nothing stops a determined agent from working on a task it
did not claim; the point is that well-behaved agents do not collide.

## Plan steps are not queue items

A task created with `plan=<slug>` is a **step of a plan**, and is excluded from
the default `tasks_ready` and `tasks_list`. That keeps a twelve-step plan from
burying the handful of tasks that are actually loose work. Pass `plan=<slug>` to
either tool to see that plan's steps instead.

## Results and refusal modes

Every successful task mutation returns the resulting task row, including its id,
status, dependency state, claim holder, and lease fields when present.

| Call | Refuses when |
|---|---|
| `tasks_add` | A blocker is missing or the new dependency would create a cycle |
| `tasks_update` | Nothing was supplied to change, a new dependency is invalid, or another live session holds the task |
| `tasks_claim` | The task is blocked, closed, or held by another live claimant; each error names the actual cause |
| `tasks_release` | The acting session is not the holder; force release exists only on the owner console/CLI surface |

An expired claim is not reported as live. Claiming that task by id succeeds at
the exact lease boundary, even while its status remains `in_progress`.

## tasks_add {#tasks_add}

Add a task to the dependency-aware ready queue. depends_on lists task ids that must finish first (done or dropped unblocks); each must exist and must not create a cycle. The task is 'ready' once it has no open/in_progress blocker.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `title` | string | **yes** | short task title |
| `body` | string | no | optional details / acceptance criteria (aliases: content, text) |
| `depends_on` | array | no | task ids this task is blocked by (a comma-separated string is also accepted) |
| `plan` | string | no | optional plan slug (plan:&lt;slug&gt; convention) that composes this task as a step of a plan. Plan steps are excluded from the default ready-queue and surfaced under the plan filter. |
| `project` | string | no | project slug; defaults to the bound/ambient session's project. An unknown slug CREATES that project -- naming a new one is normal and never an error. Pass project=global ONLY for knowledge that belongs in EVERY project's briefing; it is not a neutral default. With no session and no explicit project the call is rejected as ambiguous. |

## tasks_update {#tasks_update}

Update a task: change status (open|in_progress|done|dropped), edit title/body, or add dependencies. Moving to done/dropped closes it and unblocks its dependents. A task another session holds via a live claim is locked to its holder: updating it fails with 'already claimed' until the lease lapses or the holder releases it.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | **yes** | task id |
| `add_depends_on` | array | no | task ids to add as blockers (a comma-separated string is also accepted) |
| `body` | string | no | new body (aliases: content, text) |
| `project` | string | no | reassign the task to another project slug (used when a split moves a project's open work to a child) |
| `session` | string | no | the acting agent's session (your cc/&lt;id&gt; or cx/&lt;id&gt; from the briefing, or a session name); needed only to mutate a task you hold a live claim on when several agents are active |
| `session_id` | string | no | the acting agent's session ULID; takes precedence over session and the bound session |
| `status` | string | no | new status. One of: `open`, `in_progress`, `done`, `dropped`. |
| `title` | string | no | new title |

## tasks_ready {#tasks_ready}

List the actionable (ready) tasks for a project -- open tasks with no unfinished blocker -- oldest first, plus the blocked tasks with their still-open blockers. By default plan-step tasks are excluded; pass plan=&lt;slug&gt; to list that plan's steps instead.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `plan` | string | no | optional plan slug: return that plan's ready/blocked step tasks instead of the default (non-plan) queue |
| `project` | string | no | project slug; defaults to the bound session's project |

## tasks_list {#tasks_list}

List a project's tasks, optionally filtered by status, newest first. By default plan-step tasks are excluded; pass plan=&lt;slug&gt; to list that plan's steps instead. Pass id=&lt;task id&gt; to load a single task by its globally-unique id (a direct lookup that ignores project/status/plan and needs no session scope).

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | no | load exactly one task by its globally-unique id; when set, project/status/plan are ignored and the response's tasks array holds just that task |
| `plan` | string | no | optional plan slug: list that plan's step tasks instead of the default (non-plan) tasks |
| `project` | string | no | project slug; defaults to the bound session's project |
| `status` | string | no | optional status filter. One of: `open`, `in_progress`, `done`, `dropped`. |

## tasks_claim {#tasks_claim}

Atomically claim a task for the current session, moving it to in_progress with a lease. A refused claim names its cause: held by another live claim ('task already claimed'), waiting on unfinished dependencies ('task blocked', naming the blockers -- finish those first), or already done/dropped ('task closed'). Re-claiming a task you already hold refreshes (heartbeats) the lease; a task whose lease has expired can be reclaimed. Release it with tasks_release or by closing it (tasks_update done/dropped); session_end releases all of a session's claims.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | **yes** | task id to claim |
| `lease_seconds` | number | no | lease duration in seconds before the claim lapses and the task becomes reclaimable (default 900) |
| `session` | string | no | the acting agent's session: your cc/&lt;id&gt; or cx/&lt;id&gt; from the briefing, or a session name. Defaults to the connection's bound session, then a sole active ambient. Pass it to name yourself when several agents are active and the actor is otherwise ambiguous. |
| `session_id` | string | no | the acting agent's session ULID; takes precedence over session and the bound session |

## tasks_release {#tasks_release}

Release a task the current session holds, reopening it (status back to open, claim cleared) so another agent can claim it. Only the current holder may release.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | **yes** | task id to release |
| `session` | string | no | the acting agent's session: your cc/&lt;id&gt; or cx/&lt;id&gt; from the briefing, or a session name. Defaults to the connection's bound session, then a sole active ambient. Pass it to name yourself when several agents are active and the actor is otherwise ambiguous. |
| `session_id` | string | no | the acting agent's session ULID; takes precedence over session and the bound session |
