// Package agentproc names the agent process -- the Claude Code or Codex process
// -- that launched the current seam process.
//
// Seamless hears about one agent session on two channels that share nothing on
// the wire. The SessionStart hook creates the ambient session and knows the
// client's own session id; the MCP connection carries the agent's tool calls and
// knows only a server-minted transport id that encodes no client identity (memory
// mcp-session-id-opaque-and-restart-unstable). What the two DO share is their
// parent: the agent process runs `seam hook` for the hook, and `seam mcp-proxy`
// (stdio) or `seam mcp-headers` (the HTTP headersHelper) for the transport. So
// each of those seam processes can name the agent that launched it, and the
// daemon joins the channels on that name -- a tool call whose connection names
// the process a session-start hook named belongs to that hook's session, with no
// session_start call and no guess.
//
// The name is the nearest ancestor that is not a shell, because a client may run
// its helpers through one: Claude Code runs headersHelper with `sh -c`, while its
// exec-form hooks and stdio servers are its direct children. The name carries the
// process's start time as well as its pid, so a reused pid can never be mistaken
// for the agent that used to own it.
//
// Every failure reports false and the caller sends nothing: the daemon then
// resolves the call exactly as it did before this package existed.
