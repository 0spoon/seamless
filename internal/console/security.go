// This file holds the console's browser-boundary defenses from the 2026-07-19
// audit: response headers every console reply carries (I3) and the origin check
// that guards cookie-authenticated writes (M2).
//
// Both are deliberately header-only. The console is a single-user localhost UI
// with server-rendered forms, and the heavier versions of these controls --
// per-request CSRF tokens threaded through every form, a strict CSP the inline
// JS would have to be rewritten around -- buy little here and cost maintenance
// forever. What follows is the part that is free and invisible.

// setSecurityHeaders applies the response headers that hold for every console
// route, public or authenticated.
//
//   - nosniff: the console serves CSS, JS, SVG, JSON and HTML from the same
//     origin, and agent-authored text ends up inside several of them. Content
//     sniffing is what turns "a memory body that happens to start with <html>"
//     into a document the browser renders in this origin.
//   - DENY: nothing in the console is meant to be embedded, so framing it can
//     only be clickjacking -- and every state change here is a one-click POST
//     (archive a memory, approve a plan, apply a gardener proposal), which is
//     precisely what a clickjack aims at. This is the other half of the M2 fix:
//     the origin check below stops a forged POST, and this stops the operator
//     being tricked into making a genuine one.
//   - no-referrer: console URLs carry memory, note, and session ids in the
//     path, and rendered agent markdown may link off-site. Without this,
//     following such a link hands those ids to a third party in the Referer.

// sameOriginRequest reports whether a request demonstrably originated from the

//
// This exists because SameSite=Lax -- the console cookie's only cross-site
// defense until now -- computes "site" from the registrable domain and ignores
// the port. On loopback that makes every 127.0.0.1:<port> in existence
// same-site: any other local dev server, or any page the operator opens from
// one, can POST here and the browser will attach the console cookie. The two
// signals below are the ones that do respect the port.
//
// Preference order is deliberate. Sec-Fetch-Site is set by the browser itself
// and cannot be forged by page script; Origin is the compatibility fallback.
// "none" means the navigation had no initiator at all (a typed URL or a
// bookmark), which no attacker page can produce.
//
// A request with neither header is rejected rather than trusted. Every browser
// that can reach this code sends at least one of them on a POST, so the only
// callers this turns away are scripted ones -- and a scripted client should be
// presenting the bearer key, which skips this check entirely.
