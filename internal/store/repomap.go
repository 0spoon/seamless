// Host-scoped repo identity: which machine a working directory lives on, and
// which project the (host, path) pair maps to.
//
// Before several devices could share one daemon, "the machine" was always the
// daemon's own, so the map was a flat {path: slug} JSON setting and any mapped
// path missing from the daemon's disk meant the repo had moved. Neither holds
// once a client is remote: two machines can mount the same path on different
// repositories, and every remote path is "missing" from the daemon's disk. The
// repo_map table carries the host, and the moved-repo heal (deadOwnerPaths) is
// restricted to rows this daemon can actually stat.
//
// The repo_project_map JSON setting survives as a LOCAL-HOST MIRROR: the
// console and doctor still read it, and it is kept in step with every local
// mutation here until Phase 2 moves them onto RepoMapRows. It is also folded
// into the unnamed ("") host bucket on read, which is what makes a database
// written before this table -- or by a seeder that never named its machine --
// resolve exactly as it did before.

//     rows are stat'd, so a remote client can never trigger the remap.
//   - A slug owned on ANOTHER host is adopted when the origins match, or when
//     either side's origin is unknown: that is the same repository checked out on
//     a second device, which is the whole point of a shared daemon.
//   - Anything else -- a same-host collision, or two known and different origins
