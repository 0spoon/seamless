// FTS mirroring for the work record: tasks, trials, and session findings.
//
// The knowledge half of the corpus (memories, notes) is file-backed, so
// internal/files owns its fts rows and refreshes them from the watcher +
// startup reconcile. Tasks, trials, and sessions have no file behind them --
// the DB row IS the item -- so their mirror is maintained here, next to the
// writers, and every writer of an indexed field calls one of these.
//
// Two deliberate asymmetries with the knowledge kinds:
//
//   - No embeddings. There is no content_hash reconcile loop for a DB-native
//     row, so vectorizing one would mean a provider round-trip inside
//     tasks_add/trial_record/session_end and no way to backfill the rows that
//     predate it. These kinds are lexical-only; recall's cosine leg simply
//     finds no rows of their kind, which also means a work-record hit can never
//     out-rank a fused memory at equal lexical rank.
//   - No validity filter. A done or dropped task is exactly the row an agent
//     needs to find ("why was this not done?"), so closed work stays indexed.
//     The hit carries its status instead.
