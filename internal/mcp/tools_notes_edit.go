// note mutations already withhold) plus the diff, and the diff is the reason this
// list is longer than theirs: a diff is the note's own prose quoted back with
// surrounding context lines, so returning it would make notes_edit a second
// notes_read for anyone outside the fence -- one throwaway edit yields several
// lines of the body, and repeating it walks the whole note out.
//
// id and content_hash deliberately stay: they are the caller's own handles on the
// write it just made, not content, and without the hash a permitted writer could
// not state a precondition on its next write.

// tags field-wise, so repeating them here would be a second way to say the same
// thing, with two spellings of the tag-composition order to keep in step. A
// memory has no such tool -- memory_write renders the whole struct -- which is why
