// Process binding: how a connection reaches the session its own agent's hook
// created, without a session_start call.
//
// A Claude Code or Codex session reaches the daemon on two channels that share
// nothing on the wire. The SessionStart hook creates the ambient session; the
// MCP connection carries the agent's tool calls under a transport id that names
// no client (memory mcp-session-id-opaque-and-restart-unstable). Until this
// binding existed every connection therefore started unbound, and any call that
// needed a project or a session had to infer one from whichever agents were
// active -- an inference that refuses, rightly, as soon as agents work in two
// repos at once. Most of the agents' tool errors were that refusal, and their
// attempts to cure it with session_start were most of the rest.
//
// What the two channels share is the process that spawned them. `seam hook`
// names it on session-start and the daemon stamps it on the ambient session;
// `seam mcp-proxy` / `seam mcp-headers` / the CLI dial name it on every request
// (see internal/agentproc). A request naming the process that exactly one live
// ambient session is stamped with belongs to that session.
//
// This is identification, not inference: nothing is chosen from circumstantial
// evidence such as recency, so it binds like session_start does -- the isolation
// fence judges the call against this session's project, and a confidential
// project's own agents can read it without a ritual. It is also durable in a way
// the in-memory binding is not: it lives in the session row and on every
// request, so it survives a daemon restart and a client re-initialize alike.

// AgentProcessHeader names the agent process (agentproc.Anchor) that launched
// the MCP client: Claude Code's headersHelper output, the mcp-proxy bridge and
// the seam CLI's dial all send it. A client that sends none -- an older seam, or
// any client Seamless did not launch -- binds only through session_start, as
// before.

// row (no identity sent, a session already ended, an older hook) and several
// rows (a process hosting more than one live session -- a Claude Code process
// runs one at a time and ends the previous one on /clear and /resume, so this is
// some other host whose calls cannot be pinned) both report false, and the
