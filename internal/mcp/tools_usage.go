	// would then vary with the caller's binding, and differencing two sessions'
	// summaries would measure a fenced project's volume exactly. Project
	// existence is already public to agents by design (project_list reports every
	// project and its isolation state), so a machine-wide total discloses nothing
	// the fence promised to hide.

// fenceTopMemories drops the rows whose memory this caller may not read. A
// memory NAME is content, not metadata: a ranked list of a confidential
// project's most-injected memories is that project's table of contents, and it
// reached every caller because the ranking is machine-wide and the rows carry no
// project of their own.
//
// It DROPS rather than backfills from the next-ranked readable row. Three
// reasons, in order:
//
//  1. The store's query already applied its LIMIT, so the tool surface only ever
//     sees the top N -- backfilling would mean re-ranking inside internal/store,
//     which is where the policy would then have to be repeated.
//  2. Dropping is what the sibling per-row read fence does (trialsForCaller
//     filters a LIMIT-ed query the same way, and for the same reason), so the
//     fence tells one story rather than two.
//  3. The residual signal is weak and ambiguous: a short list is equally
//     explained by a machine with fewer than N injected memories. That is
//     exactly why no "N withheld" count is added here -- unlike a single
//     entity's write response, where the marker distinguishes "policy removed
//     this" from "the field is empty", a count beside an aggregate would be an
//     unambiguous readout of hidden volume, which is the one thing the ranking
//     must not report.
//
// An all-withheld list returns to nil rather than an empty slice, so it
// marshals as null exactly like a list that was empty to begin with -- []
// against null would reintroduce the distinction the missing count avoids. When
// nothing is dropped the input slice is returned untouched, so an open project's
// caller gets byte-for-byte the payload it got before the fence existed.

// memoryReadable answers "may this connection read the memory with this id",

//
// It fails closed on every uncertainty -- a lookup error, a row deleted since
// the summary was computed, a fence that could not be evaluated. fenceRead
// returns non-nil for a refusal and for a failed lookup alike; here they mean
// the same thing, because a row this call cannot vouch for must not be named.
