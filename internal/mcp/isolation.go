// Refusals state the rule and the remedy and never echo content: an error that
// quoted the memory it was withholding would leak the very thing the fence
// exists to keep in. They also do not hide that the project EXISTS -- every
// scope error already lists the machine's projects, so pretending otherwise
// would buy nothing and cost the agent its next move.
//
// The same contract binds a PERMITTED write's success payload (withholdContent):
// a confidential project takes writes from outside, and several of those writes
// answer with the item they just touched, so the response was a read across the
// fence even though the mutation was sanctioned.

// bound session's project, else a single unambiguous ambient project, else the

// refuses those outright), so a connection whose scope cannot be pinned is judged
// as global -- which owns nothing an isolated project fences, making the unpinned
// case fail closed against isolated targets rather than inheriting their access.
