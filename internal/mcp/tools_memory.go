// memoryName canonicalizes a caller-supplied memory name to the kebab-case form

//
// Two problems, one place. First, consistency: notes_create runs its title
// through core.Slugify, but memory_write took `name` verbatim -- so an agent
// writing "My Gotcha" got a memory it could never read back with the name it
// had just used, and a corpus that disagreed with itself about capitalization.
// Every memory tool routes through here, so write and lookup canonicalize
// identically and the two forms are the same memory. Second, errors: the
// filesystem layer already refuses unsafe names before anything reaches disk
// (so this is hygiene, not a hole), but it refuses them deep in a write path,
// which surfaces to the agent as a confusing failure rather than "that name is
// not allowed". Validating at the tool boundary says so plainly. (Audit I12.)
//
// Slugify handles most of it; the validate.Name pass catches what slugging
// cannot fix -- notably a Windows reserved device name like "con", which is
// already lowercase and dash-free and so survives slugging untouched.
