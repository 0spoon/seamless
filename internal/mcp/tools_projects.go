You usually do NOT need it to pick a scope: memory, note, and task calls inherit the project from the session binding, and passing project= is for writing outside that on purpose. Each row carries its isolation state ("+isolationStatesDesc+"), which is what a cross-project call has to respect: a confidential or sealed project is readable only from a session bound to it, and a sealed one takes no writes from outside either. It returns identity, not contents; to search what is inside a project, use recall."),
