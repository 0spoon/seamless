// editVsSupersede is the lifecycle boundary both edit tools police, in one place
// so the two descriptions cannot drift into different rules.
//
// It matters because a cheap in-place edit is exactly the tool an agent will
// reach for to change what a memory CLAIMS, and that would quietly rewrite the
// corpus's history: a superseded memory leaves the indexes but stays readable
// pointing at its replacement, which is how a later reader learns the thing was
// reconsidered rather than that it was never believed. An edit leaves no such
// trace, so it must stay confined to the changes that carry no new claim.
const editVsSupersede = "Use this for corrections that do not change what the item CLAIMS: typos, broken " +
	"formatting, a stale path or command, a stage's Status flip, metadata. If the MEANING changes -- the " +
	"conclusion is now different, the advice reversed -- that is a new memory: use memory_write with " +
	"supersedes, which retires the old one into readable history instead of erasing what it used to say."

// memoryEditContentFields is what memory_edit withholds from a caller that may
// write the target project but not READ it: the diff, which is the memory's own
// authored text quoted back with its surrounding context lines. Returning it
// would make memory_edit a second memory_read for anyone outside the fence --
// one throwaway edit yields several lines of the body, and repeating it walks
// the whole memory out. id, name, project and content_hash stay: they are the
// caller's own handles on the write it just made, not content.
//
// It is the guard for the SHAPE rather than a live path today: this tool
// addresses by name+project, so resolveReadScope's fence has already refused an
// outside caller before any write happens. That stops holding the moment
// memory_edit grows id addressing the way notes_edit has -- a ULID resolves no
// scope, fenceWrite lets an outside write into a confidential project land on
// purpose, and the diff would then be the read that same fence refuses.
