// TestGardenerRequestScope pins the token-to-scope mapping at the boundary.
//
// It is a same-package test because the interesting part is not reachable from
// the tool surface: gardener_request needs an LLM to get past scope resolution,
// so the differences that matter here -- "global" is not "all", and an omitted
// project is not "all" either -- are invisible to a black-box call against a
// chat-less fixture.
//
// The omitted case is the decided behavior change and the reason this test
// exists. It used to scan every project on the machine with no ambiguity check;
// it now resolves like every other read, which is the "no automatic fallbacks for
// ambiguous requests" directive finally reaching the last tool that ignored it.
