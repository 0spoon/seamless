// `seam hook <arg>` command hook it can wire, keyed by the arg, on either
// transport: an https base URL makes every Claude Code hook a command hook
// (profileForBaseURL), so Claude Code's user-prompt-submit is here although an
// http install wires it as an http hook. An arg wired with two timeouts keeps
// the shorter one; today the transport changes a hook's type, never its
// timeout.
//
// It exists for the seam CLI's test, like CommandHookEndpoints. The CLI sets
// how long each hook re-dials a daemon it cannot dial, per event and client
// (cmd/seam/hook.go hookEvents and hookClientDialBudgets), and cannot import
// this package to read the timeouts that budget must fit inside, so its test
// pins each client's budget at or under half of that client's timeout here: a
// hook whose dials are all refused then fails open on its own, well before its
// client kills it.
