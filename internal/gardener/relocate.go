// The provenance audit: the one gardener pass a fence cannot do for itself.
//
// Every other isolation fence is forward-looking -- once a project is
// confidential or sealed, the read funnel, the write funnel, the briefing and
// the cross-project passes all refuse to move its knowledge. None of that
// reaches knowledge that ALREADY left: global memories written by sessions bound
// to the project, back when writing globally was allowed. Those memories are
// global, so no scope check will ever fence them, and no owner can be expected
// to remember which of their global memories came out of which project.
//
// So a tighten asks the question once, per memory, in the inbox: should this
// come back inside the fence? Propose-only like every other pass -- the audit
// files proposals and moves nothing.
