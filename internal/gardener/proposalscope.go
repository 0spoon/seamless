//
// A gardener_proposals row has no project column: the project a proposal is
// ABOUT lives inside its untyped payload, spelled differently per kind -- a
// memory id to load, a slug carried directly, a from/to pair for a move, a whole
// set of not-yet-created slugs for a split. The agent-facing tool surface cannot
// fence what it cannot attribute, so that spelling is decoded here, once, for
// every kind in store.ProposalKinds.
//
// Two rules make this a fence rather than a convenience:
//
//  1. A proposal spanning two projects is readable only when the caller may read
//     BOTH of them, never either. See ProposalFence.Readable.
//  2. A payload this cannot attribute FAILS CLOSED -- an unresolved scope is
//     readable by nobody at the tool surface. See ProposalScope.Resolved.
//
// The console reaches the gardener directly (store.PendingProposals and
// Service.Apply), never through this, and stays exempt by design: the threat
// model is agent-to-agent leakage, not hiding from the owner.
