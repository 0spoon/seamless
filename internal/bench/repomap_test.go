// A seeded arm is only worth anything if the agent's session BINDS to the
// project the seed filled. That binding is a textual comparison between the
// repo->project map and the cwd the agent's client reports -- and every client
// reports a symlink-resolved cwd, while a fixture computes its paths from
// $TMPDIR, which on macOS lives under /var -> /private/var.
//
// Get that wrong and nothing errors. SessionStart simply misses the mapping,
// registers the same directory a second time under a fresh slug, and hands the
// agent an empty briefing: the memories, plan, tasks and findings are all still
// there, under the first project, invisible. Every Seamless-ful arm then grades
// as "the mechanism did not fire", which is indistinguishable from Seamless
// genuinely not helping -- a zero-uplift reading produced entirely by a path
// string. It cost a full suite once (2026-07-28); this test is why it cannot
// again.
