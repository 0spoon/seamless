package config

// The one HTTP client both binaries use to reach a Seamless daemon.
//
// It lives in config, rather than in either command, because both need it and
// neither can import the other (both are package main), and because config is
// already where its inputs are: ServerURL, ServerHost and TLS.CAFile. Putting it
// anywhere else is what produced the second and third copies this file replaced
// -- each written to dodge an import edge, and each a place where the trust
// decision could quietly differ from the others.

// DialTimeout bounds how long a client waits to ESTABLISH a connection to the
// daemon. It is separate from the whole-request deadline because a down daemon
// must fail fast even on the surfaces where the response may legitimately take
// minutes (the mcp-proxy bridge, whose tool calls can be LLM-backed).
const DialTimeout = 5 * time.Second

// HTTPClient is the one HTTP client constructor for talking to a Seamless
// daemon. Every surface that carries the bearer key goes through it -- the seam
// CLI's hook, mcp-proxy, doctor, status, version, console JSON and MCP dial, and
// seamlessd's own client-role surfaces (install-hooks reading the server's
// feature state, the client-role doctor's live tools/list count) -- because the
// TLS trust decision must be identical on all of them: an https server_url with
// a private CA either verifies everywhere or the install half-works in a way
// that reads as an intermittent network fault.
//
// That sharing is the point, and it is load-bearing beyond tidiness: the
// alternative a caller reaches for when this constructor is out of import range
// is its own client, and the shortest such client is one that skips
// verification. A bearer key must never travel over a connection whose
// certificate was not verified, so the constructor has to be reachable from
// every binary that holds the key.
//
// timeout is the whole-request deadline; 0 means none (the mcp-proxy bridge,
// whose tool calls can be LLM-slow). DialTimeout applies either way.
//
// A configured-but-unusable tls.ca_file is an ERROR, never a silent fall back to
// the system pool: the request would then fail at the TLS handshake and look
// exactly like an outage, which is the local-vs-remote distinction AGENTS.md
// requires be kept (llm-degradation-remote-vs-local, same rule). The error names
// the config key, because the repair is in this machine's file and nowhere else.
