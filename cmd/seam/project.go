// fence, backed by the same console route the Overview control posts to.
//
// The asymmetry is the console's, mirrored rather than reinvented: loosening is
// immediate (nothing leaked while the fence was up, so the change is fully
// reversible), while tightening changes what every OTHER agent can see and
// detaches the project from its families and parent, so it prints exactly what it
// would change and applies nothing without --yes. --yes is the console confirm
// panel's confirm=1, so there is one round trip either way and the SERVER -- not
// this client -- decides which direction the request was.
