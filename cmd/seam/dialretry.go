package main

// Riding out a daemon restart: the dial-phase retry that seam mcp-proxy and
// seam hook share.
//
// An automatic update restarts seamlessd while agent sessions are open (on
// macOS a ~2s launchd bootout/bootstrap), and both surfaces have to survive it:
// the bridge is a stdio MCP server its client will not restart, and a hook that
// fails loses its payload. While the daemon is down its port refuses
// connections, so both re-dial for a bounded window.
//
// The rule they share: a request is re-sent only when it provably never left
// this process. Tool calls and hook payloads are not idempotent -- memory_write,
// tasks_add and session-start all create something -- so once a connection
// existed a failure is final, whatever it looks like: the daemon may have read
// the request and acted on it before the connection died.
//
// "Provably" is read from httptrace, not from the error text:
//
//   - The failing attempt never held a connection: GetConn opened it and no
//     GotConn followed. With no connection there is nothing to write on. The
//     write-side hooks cannot carry this: WroteHeaders and WroteRequest fire
//     when the request reaches the transport's buffer, before its write loop
//     flushes it, so they prove neither that bytes left nor that they did not.
//   - No attempt read a response byte. A redirect is a response, and the hop
//     after it can fail to dial after the first hop already has the request.
//
// Of what was not sent, only the dialer's own failure is retried: a
// *net.OpError with Op "dial" (refused, unreachable, timed out, unresolvable),
// matched by type because a refused connect reads differently on each OS. A
// TLS verification failure also comes before any connection, but it is a
// configuration fault no retry clears, so it is reported at once.
//
// net/http's own retry is the other half and stays net/http's: on a reused
// keep-alive connection it re-sends a POST only when not one byte was written
// (which needs Request.GetBody; a bytes.Reader body has it), and never after
// bytes went out (transport.go, shouldRetryRequest). After a restart the dead
// pooled connection is normally gone before the next request -- the transport
// drops it when the old daemon's FIN arrives, measured well under a millisecond
// on loopback -- so that request dials, is refused, and lands here.
