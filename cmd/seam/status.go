//
// It used to print `projects: (mcp unavailable: ...)` and return nil: the command
// whose whole purpose is answering "is this thing up?" exited 0 when the answer
// was no, which makes it useless as a scripted health gate. The two halves are not
// in tension -- the status lines are the command's OUTPUT (they are what the
// caller asked for, and a partial answer beats none), while the failure is its
// RESULT. Nor is it an AGENTS.md "log or return, never both" violation: the lines
// are the product, not a log of the error, and the error is returned once and
// printed once by the caller.
//
// The shape is doctor's -- print every check, count the failures, aggregate at the
// end -- and the precedent for "server down = error" was already established
// inside this very function: the /healthz branch below has always returned an
// error. It was the MCP branches that were the inconsistency.
//
// Exit 1, not 2: the command line was fine, the server wasn't.
