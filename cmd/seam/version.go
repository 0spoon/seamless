seam carries no version of its own. Both binaries ship from one tag and one
commit, so a number stamped into seam could only repeat this one or contradict
it, and only the daemon can report what is actually RUNNING -- an installed CLI
sitting next to a daemon nobody restarted would otherwise report the new version
for a process still serving the old one.

The version therefore comes from the daemon's /healthz, and an unreachable daemon
is a failure rather than a fallback: there is no second source to fall back to,
and printing seam's own build here is the exact confusion this avoids.`)

// /healthz reports version as buildVersion() ("0.3.8+1a2b3c4") plus commit and

// reassembles that one line rather than inventing a second format for the same
