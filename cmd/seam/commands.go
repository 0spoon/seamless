// The command table: ordering only.
//
// Every spec lives next to its handler (var captureCmd = spec(...) above
// runCapture), so one-file-per-command survives and a command's contract sits
// where its code does. This file decides only what order the reader meets them
// in, which is also the order help renders.
//
// This is now the whole command set: hook was the last migration, so there is no
// second place a command can be declared and nothing left for help and the parser
// to disagree about.

// Group headings, in help order. Declared as constants rather than written at
// each spec so a typo cannot silently open a second section.

// share one table across parses when the point is that binding is per-call.
