// not merely be uninformative on one, they would be answering about a machine
// that is somewhere else. What is left is genuinely this install's: which server
// it dials, whether that server answers, the key it will present, and the
// client-side wiring (hooks, skills, MCP registrations) that points at both.
//
// Deliberately absent, and each for its own reason:
//   - database, schema version, repo map, remote sessions, feature skills --
//     all read the local seam.db, which a client does not have.
//   - gardener -- a maintenance loop that runs inside the daemon; naming its
//     ticker here would describe the server's configuration from the wrong file.
//   - llm, embedder -- the SERVER embeds and calls the model. Warning a client
//     that "recall degrades to FTS" would report a degradation that is neither
//     this machine's nor, on a properly configured server, true.
//   - bind, tls -- transportChecks already refuses to report a bind address an
//     install never binds, or a server certificate it does not hold.
//
// The hook and MCP comparisons are the SAME desired-state ones the server role
// runs, built from the current config through doctorInstallOptions rather than
// from the installed artifact -- a client's stale hook is drift by the same rule.
//
// mcp_tools is the one check that changes MEANING rather than disappearing. On a
// server it counts REGISTRATION inside this process (mcpToolsCheck); on a client
// this process registers nothing and serves nothing, so the same line would be a
// fact about a daemon this install does not run. clientMCPToolsCheck asks the
