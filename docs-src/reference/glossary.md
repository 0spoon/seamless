title: Glossary
description: The vocabulary, with the distinctions that actually matter - memory vs note vs finding, briefing vs recall, archive vs supersede vs delete.
---

Terms are listed alphabetically. The ones worth reading even if you think you
know them are the four **disambiguation** entries at the end: each is a pair
people routinely use interchangeably, and each pair means genuinely different
things.

## A–Z

**Ambient session** - a Seamless session opened automatically by a Claude Code
or Codex SessionStart hook, without the agent asking, displayed with an opaque
`cc/...` or `cx/...` handle. Lifecycle identity uses the full external session
ID plus client, not the display handle. Contrast *explicit session*.

**Arbitration** - the Seamless lifecycle step that decides which of several
competing memories wins when they disagree, alongside supersession and
provenance.

**Archive** - marking a Seamless memory invalid because it is no longer
relevant: it leaves the indexes and stays readable. Proposed by the gardener's
staleness pass, never done to a `constraint` or a pinned `stage`.

**Binding** - the association between an MCP connection and a Seamless session,
set by `session_start`; everything on that connection inherits the bound
session's project.

**Briefing** - the `<seam-briefing>` context block Seamless injects into an
agent at session start - constraints, pinned stages, plan rollups, the memory
index, recent findings - assembled inside a token budget. See [Sessions &
briefings](/concepts/sessions/).

**Claim** - an atomic, leased hold on a Seamless task, taken with `tasks_claim`;
exactly one agent can hold a live claim.

**Console** - Seamless's read-mostly web UI at `/console`, an observability
surface for the human owner; agents use MCP.

**Constraint** - the Seamless memory kind for a rule the project cannot
violate; pinned into every briefing, never dropped for budget, never
staleness-archived.

**Description** - the one-line summary in a Seamless memory's frontmatter, the
**only** text shown in any index and therefore the entire retrieval surface.
See [Write memories that get recalled](/guides/write-good-memories/).

**Digest** - a note summarizing a Seamless project's recent activity, proposed
by the gardener.

**Explicit session** - a Seamless session opened by calling `session_start`; it
adopts the ambient session for the same working directory rather than opening a
second one.

**Family** - a set of Seamless projects related by parent/child, so a child's
briefing can carry the parent's memories and a sibling's recent findings.

**Fail closed** - the Seamless rule that a durable write with no resolvable
scope is rejected rather than defaulted to global. See [Projects &
scope](/concepts/projects/).

**Fail open** - the Seamless rule that a hook never blocks an agent: an
internal error still returns success. The cost is that failure is silent.

**Finding** - what a Seamless session learned, passed to `session_end` and
surfaced in later briefings. Not a memory: a finding is what *happened*, a
memory is what is *true*.

**FTS5** - SQLite's built-in full-text search engine, the keyword half of
Seamless recall.

**Gardener** - the Seamless background pass that finds duplicates, staleness,
and drift and **proposes** fixes; it never acts on its own. See [The
gardener](/concepts/gardener/).

**Global** - the Seamless scope with no project, visible to every agent in
every repo; reached only by passing `project: global` deliberately.

**Kind** - a Seamless memory's type: `constraint`, `runbook`, `protocol`,
`gotcha`, `decision`, `refuted`, `reference`, or `stage`. See [Memory &
notes](/concepts/memory/).

**Lab** - a shared Seamless workspace for a systematic investigation, holding
trials; opened with `lab_open`.

**Lease** - the expiry on a Seamless task claim (default 900 seconds).
Re-claiming refreshes it; an expired lease is reclaimable, so a crashed agent
does not strand a task.

**Memory** - in Seamless, a markdown file with YAML frontmatter holding one
durable piece of knowledge; the unit that reaches briefings.

**Note** - in Seamless, a markdown file holding a work artifact - research
findings, a meeting summary, a design record; found via recall, never injected
into a briefing.

**Plan** - in Seamless, not a primitive but a composition keyed by
`plan:<slug>`: a narrative note, supporting notes, and step tasks. See [Tasks &
plans](/concepts/tasks-and-plans/).

**Project** - the scope a Seamless memory, note, task, or session belongs to;
resolved from an explicit argument, a bound session, or the agent's cwd.

**Proposal** - the Seamless gardener's output: a suggestion for the owner to
review, applied only with `gardener_apply`.

**Provenance** - the Seamless record of where knowledge came from and what
replaced it: `source_session`, `superseded_by`, `invalid_at`.

**Ready** - a Seamless task with no unfinished blocker; `tasks_ready` returns
exactly those.

**Recall** - Seamless's single search entry point, fusing FTS5 keyword matching
and vector similarity with RRF. Also, loosely, the `<seam-recall>` block
injected on prompt match - see the disambiguation below.

**Reproject** - moving a Seamless memory to a different project that **already
exists**; moving it to one that does not is a *split*.

**RRF (reciprocal rank fusion)** - the method Seamless recall uses to combine
the keyword and vector rankings so neither retriever gets a veto.

**Session** - one agent's stretch of work in Seamless. Sessions heartbeat; an
idle one is reaped and marked `expired`.

**Split** - dividing one Seamless project into new child projects, creating
them and a shared parent; planned as a unit by `gardener_split`.

**Stage** - the Seamless memory kind recording where multi-session work stands;
pinned into briefings like a constraint.

**Supersede** - replacing an outdated Seamless memory with a new one: the old
is marked invalid, leaves the indexes, and stays readable pointing at its
replacement.

**Trial** - one attempt recorded in a Seamless lab: what was tried, what was
expected, what happened.

**ULID** - the id format Seamless uses everywhere, sortable by creation time.
Never UUID.

## Four distinctions worth getting right

**Memory vs. note vs. finding.** A *memory* is what is true (injected into
briefings). A *note* is what you produced (found by searching). A *finding* is
what a session learned (surfaced as recent activity). The test for the first
two: would a future agent need this injected before it starts? Then it is a
memory.

**Briefing vs. recall injection vs. recall call.** All three end with the agent
knowing something, which is why they blur. The *briefing* fires at session start
and is unconditional. A *recall injection* fires on prompt match, mid-turn, still
without the agent asking. A *recall call* is the agent choosing to search. The
first two are ambient; only the third is a decision. See
[Recall](/concepts/recall/).

**Ambient vs. explicit session.** *Ambient* is opened by the hook, per agent,
automatically. *Explicit* is `session_start`, which **adopts** the ambient one
rather than creating a rival.

**Archive vs. supersede vs. delete.** *Archive*: no longer relevant, marked
invalid, still readable. *Supersede*: replaced by something specific, marked
invalid, still readable, **pointing at its replacement**. *Delete*: gone. The
rule of thumb - delete is for things that were never true; supersede is for
things that stopped being true; archive is for things that stopped mattering.
