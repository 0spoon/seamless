## A note is not a memory

This is the most common confusion in the whole system, so it is worth being blunt
about it.

|  | Memory | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Answers | "What is true about this project?" | "What did we produce?" |
| Length | One idea, one line of `description` | However long the artifact is |
| Lifecycle | Superseded and archived | Written, occasionally updated |
| Reaches a briefing | Yes - this is what agents get injected | No; found via `recall` |
| Good examples | A constraint, a gotcha, a decision | Research findings, a meeting summary, a design record |

The test: **would a future agent need this injected into its context before it
starts working?** If yes, it is a memory, and it needs to fit in a `description`.
If it is something you'd want to *find* and read in full when the topic comes up,
it is a note.

Writing a journal entry into memory is the classic failure: it is too long to
inject, too specific to generalize, and it pushes real constraints out of the
briefing's budget.

Agent-created notes are automatically tagged `created-by:agent`.

## Four ways to change a note

Notes are long, and the transport caps a request body at 1 MB, so resending a
whole note to fix one paragraph is both wasteful and the thing most likely to
fail on the biggest artifacts.

| You want to | Use | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Fix or restructure part of the body | `notes_edit` | Exact search/replace, all-or-nothing, returns a diff |
| Replace the body, or change title/description/project/tags | `notes_update` | Field-wise patch; omitted fields are untouched |
| Add to the end | `notes_append` | A UTC-timestamped line joins the body |
| Remove an artifact that should not exist | `notes_delete` | Gone, with no pointer left behind |

`notes_edit` takes the note's `id` and a list of `{old_string, new_string}`
edits. Each `old_string` must match the current body exactly and uniquely - or
pass `replace_all` - and if any edit fails to match, **nothing** is written. That
refusal is the feature: a partial apply, or a fuzzy match landing somewhere
plausible, is the silent corruption the exact-match contract exists to prevent.

`notes_update` gains the same staleness guard (`expect_hash`) plus `tags_add` and
`tags_remove`, which are race-friendlier than replacing the whole tag list and
are the only way to clear a tag - an empty `tags` array reads as absent. See
[Concurrency](/reference/mcp/sessions-memory-recall/#concurrency-content_hash-and-expect_hash).

Every note mutation now records a `note.written` event, and `notes_read` records
`note.read` - the note-side twin of `memory.read`, which is what lets note demand
count toward [recall's utility nudge](/concepts/recall/#the-utility-nudge).

## Notes are how plans get their narrative

A plan is not a primitive - it is a composition keyed by `plan:<slug>`. Tag a
note `plan:<slug>` and it joins that plan's supporting context, so the next agent
inherits the design and the reasoning behind it, not just the step list. See
[Tasks](/reference/mcp/tasks/) for the step half of the composition.

## Projects and scope

`project_list` and `project_create` manage the scopes everything else inherits.
Most agents never call either: a git repo maps itself on the first session and
resolves its project from the agent's working directory, and `session_start`
binds it.

The `global` project slug is the deliberate cross-project scope. It is a token
you pass on purpose, never a default you fall into - see the fail-closed rule in
the [MCP API overview](/reference/mcp/).

## capture_url is SSRF-safe on purpose

`capture_url` fetches a URL and returns its content as markdown. It is the one
tool that makes an outbound request on an agent's behalf, so it is guarded:
destination ports are restricted to `capture.allowed_ports` (80 and 443 by
default, never "any port"), and the fetcher refuses to be talked into reaching
things it should not. See [Configuration](/reference/configuration/).

Scope resolves before the network fetch, so an ambiguous durable destination
fails without making a request. Success returns the note's `id`, `slug`, `title`,
resolved `project`, and `source_url` - the URL as requested; redirects are
followed but do not rewrite it. The fetcher validates the initial URL and every
redirect, rejecting non-HTTP schemes, private/loopback destinations, and
disallowed ports. Size is bounded by truncation rather than rejection: at most
2 MB of the response is read, and the stored readable body is capped again at
50,000 runes with a visible `[content truncated]` marker.
