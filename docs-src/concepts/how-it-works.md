title: How Seamless works
description: One daemon, three surfaces, and a hard line between the files that are truth and the database that is an index.
---

Seamless is a local-first memory and coordination system for coding agents.
The release ships a daemon (`seamlessd`) and its headless client (`seam`); one
daemon process owns one SQLite database and one directory of markdown files,
bound to loopback on your machine. Agents reach it over MCP,
hooks make sessions ambient for Claude Code and Codex, and you watch through a
read-mostly console. It is deliberately not a distributed system - one
instance, one port, one data directory per machine. Everything below follows
from that.

## One daemon, three surfaces

</figure>

- **Agents** speak MCP at `/api/mcp`. This is the primary interface; the clients
  of Seamless are programs, not people.
- **Hooks** are how sessions become ambient. Claude Code calls them at session
  start, on each prompt, and at session end, so an agent gets briefed and
  harvested without ever choosing to.
- **You** get a read-mostly console. It is an observability surface, not the way
  the system is driven.

One instance per machine, one port, one data directory. Not a distributed system,
by choice.

## Files are truth; the database is an index

This is the load-bearing decision in the whole design.

| | Lives in | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Memories, notes | **Markdown files** | Durable knowledge you own: readable, greppable, editable, git-able |
| Sessions, tasks, trials, events, telemetry | **SQLite** | High-churn state with no reason to be a file |
| FTS index, embeddings | **SQLite** | Derived data, rebuildable from the files |

So: **what would you lose if `seam.db` were deleted?** The sessions, the task
queue, the trials, and the event log - the record of what *happened*. You would
not lose a single memory or note, because those are files, and startup
reconciliation rebuilds their index from the disk.

That asymmetry is the point. The knowledge is yours in the strongest sense: it
survives this program. If Seamless disappeared tomorrow, you would still have a
folder of markdown files that a human - or any other tool - can read.

## The write path

<figure class="doc-figure" data-tone="ok" aria-labelledby="write-path-caption">
  <span class="figure-kicker">Write path</span>
  <div class="doc-flow cols-4">
    <div class="flow-node"><span class="flow-step">1 · request</span><strong>memory_write</strong><small>Validate name, content, and scope</small></div>
    <div class="flow-node emphasis"><span class="flow-step">2 · durable act</span><strong>Atomic Markdown write</strong><small>Fail closed when scope is ambiguous</small></div>
    <div class="flow-node"><span class="flow-step">3 · rebuildable</span><strong>FTS + embedding</strong><small>Index the exact file content</small></div>
    <div class="flow-node success"><span class="flow-step">4 · observable</span><strong>Append event</strong><small>Record what happened</small></div>
  </div>
  <figcaption id="write-path-caption"><strong>The file is the durable boundary.</strong> SQLite mirrors make the knowledge searchable and observable.</figcaption>
</figure>

The file write is the one that matters. Indexing after it can fail and be
rebuilt; the file is already on disk.

## The read path

<figure class="doc-figure" data-tone="pop" aria-labelledby="read-path-caption">
  <span class="figure-kicker">Three retrieval paths</span>
  <div class="doc-stack">
    <div class="flow-node"><span class="flow-step">SessionStart</span><strong>cwd → project → budgeted briefing → inject</strong><small>Baseline context before the first action</small></div>
    <div class="flow-node"><span class="flow-step">UserPromptSubmit</span><strong>prompt match → &lt;seam-recall&gt; → inject</strong><small>Focused context for the current request</small></div>
    <div class="flow-node"><span class="flow-step">recall</span><strong>FTS5 + cosine → RRF fusion → budget → return</strong><small>Explicit search initiated by the agent</small></div>
  </div>
  <figcaption id="read-path-caption">Automatic briefing, prompt-matched injection, and explicit recall share the same knowledge but answer different moments in an agent run.</figcaption>
</figure>

All three are covered in [Recall](/concepts/recall/) and
[Sessions & briefings](/concepts/sessions/).

## What Seamless is not

- **Not a RAG pipeline over your codebase.** It stores what agents *learned*, not
  what the code says. The code is already in the repo; duplicating it into memory
  is how a store fills with noise.
- **Not a vector database.** Vectors are float32 blobs in SQLite, scanned
  exactly. No ANN index, no separate service.
- **Not a cloud service.** No account, no sync, and no outbound product
  telemetry. The local event and retrieval telemetry shown in the console never
  leaves the machine. The bind is loopback and the key is static.
- **Not autonomous.** The gardener proposes; you decide. Nothing rewrites your
  knowledge behind your back.
- **Not a chat memory.** It is not trying to remember your conversation. It
  remembers decisions, constraints, and dead ends across many agents and many
  months.
