title: Import, back up & restore
description: One archive with seamlessd export, restoring or merging it with seamlessd import, putting ~/.seamless in git, what deleting seam.db actually costs, and moving to a new machine.

Because durable knowledge is markdown files, backup and restore are boring - and
that is the feature. This page is mostly about knowing which half of
`~/.seamless` is precious and which half regenerates.

## What is precious, and what is not

`seam.db` holds two different kinds of thing, and conflating them is what makes
people either over-protect it or under-protect it:

| In `seam.db` | If it were lost |
|---|---|
| FTS index, embeddings | **Rebuilt automatically** from the files |
| Sessions, tasks, trials, events, telemetry, briefing overrides | **Gone** - there is no file to rebuild them from |

So: **deleting `seam.db` costs you the record of what happened, not the knowledge
of what is true.** Every memory and note survives, because they are files.

## Put it in git

The strongest backup is the one you already know how to use:

```bash
cd ~/.seamless
git init
printf 'seam.db\nseam.db-wal\nseam.db-shm\n' > .gitignore
git add . && git commit -m "seamless: initial"
```

Ignoring the database is deliberate. It is a binary that changes constantly, it
does not diff usefully, and its contents are either rebuildable or high-churn
state that a nightly commit would capture uselessly. What you want in git is the
knowledge - and that diffs beautifully, because it is markdown.

Commit periodically (a cron job or a `launchd` timer is plenty). The payoff is
that `git log` over your memory directory is a real history of what your agents
learned and when they changed their minds.

Git gives you the knowledge with a history. It deliberately leaves out the other
half - sessions, tasks, trials, events - which is what
[`seamlessd export`](#the-whole-instance-in-one-archive) is for. They compose:
git for the diffable record of what your agents learned, an archive for the whole
instance.

## The whole instance in one archive

```bash
seamlessd export
# wrote /Users/you/seamless-nuc.local-20260923T220501Z.tar.gz (4.1 MiB)
#   host nuc.local, seamlessd 0.9.1, created 2026-09-23T22:05:01Z
#   corpus: 214 memories, 38 notes
#   database: schema v25, 18422 rows across 21 tables
```

One gzipped tar with the markdown corpus, a consistent snapshot of `seam.db`, and
a manifest describing what is inside. Full flags in
[the CLI reference](/reference/cli-seamlessd/#seamlessd_export).

Three things worth knowing:

- **Run it while the daemon is up.** The snapshot is SQLite's `VACUUM INTO`,
  taken inside a read transaction, so a write in flight is simply not in it. No
  `cp` of a WAL-mode database, no stopping anything. (A plain `cp` of
  `seam.db` under a live writer can capture a torn state; this cannot.)
- **The key is not in it.** Config and `mcp.api_key` are deliberately excluded,
  so an archive can go to a NAS or another machine without carrying this
  machine's only credential.
- **`-` streams.** `seamlessd export -o - | ssh backup-box 'cat > seam.tgz'`
  writes the archive to stdout and the report to stderr.

`--no-db` gives you a knowledge-only archive: the two markdown trees, nothing
else. It is the tarball equivalent of the git recipe above.

## Restore

```bash
seamlessd stop
seamlessd import --from seamless-nuc.local-20260923T220501Z.tar.gz
seamlessd doctor && seamlessd start
```

Into an **empty** data directory, that is a restore: every `.md` lands
byte-for-byte and the database snapshot is renamed into place last. Into a
**populated** one it is a merge instead, first-writer-wins by ULID. Which one it
will be is a property of the destination, is printed in the report, and cannot be
overridden - so there is no way to ask for a restore and get a populated instance
wiped. Add `--dry-run` to see the mode and the counts without writing anything.

A restore refuses while a daemon is answering for that data directory (it would
be replacing `seam.db` underneath it) and names `seamlessd stop`; `--force`
overrides. A merge does not need the daemon down.

You can also restore the knowledge alone, from an archive or from git:

```bash
# files back in place
cp -R backup/memory backup/notes ~/.seamless/
make run
```

Startup reconciliation walks the tree, notices which files the index does not
know about (or whose content hash changed), and indexes them. A file watcher
keeps it in sync from then on. You do not run a reindex command, because there
isn't one to forget.

To force a full rebuild, stop the daemon, delete `seam.db`, and start it again.
You lose sessions, tasks, trials, and events; you lose no knowledge.

## Merging two instances

Importing an archive into an instance that already has data is a **merge**, and
it is idempotent: anything whose ULID is already here is skipped, so running the
same archive twice inserts zero the second time. That makes it the way to fold a
laptop's instance into a desktop's, or several devices' into one.

Two rules keep it honest:

- **Collisions are reported, never resolved.** A memory whose path is already
  held by a different item is left unwritten and both ids are printed; a session
  name or project slug already taken is reported rather than renamed. Deciding
  which one wins is yours.
- **This machine's settings stay this machine's.** Repo mappings, families,
  briefing overrides, and the embedder switch are not merged, and neither are
  embeddings - vectors belong to whichever model you run here, so imported items
  are embedded on write instead.

## Import from Seam v1

```bash
seamlessd import --from ~/.seam
```

`seamlessd import` fronts two operations and picks between them by what
`--from` names on disk: a **directory** is a Seam v1 store, a **file** (or `-`)
is an archive. Point it at a v1 data directory and it brings that store's
memories, sessions, and tool-call events into `seam.db`. It is **idempotent**:
running it twice does not double anything, so a partial import is safe to re-run.

## Hand-editing

Files are the source of truth, so editing them by hand is allowed and expected -
the watcher picks up your change and reindexes it.

Two rules:

1. **Never hand-stamp `invalid_at` or `superseded_by`.** Those are set by the
   supersede path, which also updates the indexes and the pointer between the two
   memories. Writing them by hand produces a file that says one thing and a
   database that believes another, and the lifecycle invariants (stamp once,
   point only at an active memory, never self-supersede) stop being true. Use
   `memory_write` with `supersedes` - see [Memory & notes](/concepts/memory/).
2. **Do not hand-edit `id`.** It is a ULID assigned once and referenced by
   `superseded_by` pointers elsewhere.

Everything else - the body, the description, tags, the kind - is yours to edit in
any text editor.

## Moving machines

```bash
# on the old machine
seamlessd export -o seamless.tar.gz

# on the new one
make install                        # seeds a config with a NEW generated key
seamlessd stop                      # the installer starts the service
seamlessd import --from seamless.tar.gz
seamlessd doctor && seamlessd start
```

The new machine's data directory is empty, so this is a restore: every memory
and note lands byte-for-byte, and the sessions, tasks, trials, and events come
with it. If you are folding the old machine into an instance that already has
data, the same command is a merge instead - see
[Merging two instances](#merging-two-instances).

The install generates a fresh `mcp.api_key` rather than copying the old config:
the key is the only credential, it is deliberately not in the archive, and a
machine migration is a good moment not to spread it around. See
[Install & deploy](/install/).

If all you want is the knowledge, the git recipe moves it just as well
(`git clone <remote> ~/.seamless`), and so does `seamlessd export --no-db`. The
index rebuilds itself on first start either way.
